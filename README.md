### Features.
1. A search bar that allows users to search for books by title.

3. A reading list that displays all the books that the teacher has added.
4. A button to remove a book from the reading list.

Additional nice to haves.
- Books in the searchbar are ordered by their reading level respectively.
- Implemented infinite loading of books a modern aproach to pagination.
