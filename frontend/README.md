### Description.
## Challenge
As part of our goal to have Ello impact as many children as we can, we offer an Ello web viewer product. [https://books.ello.com](https://books.ello.com/)


We give this to certain schools for free to allow teachers to share our books with children. 
You are building part of the teacher-facing UI for this product,
namely the book assignment view, where teachers can assign books to students. 

The view should have the following features:-

1. A search bar that allows users to search for books by title.
2. A list of search results that displays the book title, author, and a button to add the book to the students reading list.
3. A reading list that displays all the books that the teacher has added.
4. A button to remove a book from the reading list.

## How to run the program.

## Frontend
Install node packages.
